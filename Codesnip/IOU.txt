Let f[i][j] = how many money i owes j

#It can be proved we only need to loop n times.

Loop n times do:

For i,j,k in [1..n]

    If f[i][j]>0 and f[j][k]>0 then

       Let  delta = min (f[i][j], f[j][k])

       Decrease f[i][j] and f[j][k] by delta

       Increase f[i][k] by delta
Answer will be sum{f[i][j]}
